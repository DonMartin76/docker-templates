# Docker Templates

These docker templates provide simple setups for some of the open source tools I am using. Since I am working on a Mac, all Vagrant scripts provision the 
docker container in an improved version of the 'boot2docker' VM.

Happy hacking and feel free to contribute using the usual clone and pull.
